name	Cracked Greenhouse panel	Greenhouse Structural Damage	A Bountiful Greenhouse Module	Unusual plant in a greenhouse
text	One of our Greenhouses has a panel showing some growing cracks. What should we do?	"There is a Greenhouse support that was accidentally damaged by a farmer over this last year. The damage appears minor, though there is no way of telling. Even small structural damage to planetary modules can lead to catastrophic failure if left untended. "	"Over the past year, this particular Greenhouse has produced an extra 100 food! What shall we do with the surplus?"	"We've found an odd plant growing among our crops; it appears to be the only one, and it's unlike anything our farmer's know of."
